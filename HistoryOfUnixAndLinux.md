# History of Unix and Linux

---

**Majority of the popular Operating Systems (OS) that exists today, there are really two groups (leaving niches ones aside), _Microsoft Family_ and _Unix Family_.**

- **Microsoft Family**: Windows OS, specifically descendent of _Microsoft NT_.
- **Unix Family**: Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, etc.

## What is Unix?

---

**Unix was an operating system developed at AT&T Bell Labs in the late 1960s. Many of the innovations and design choices the original Unix team have lived on 50+ years later, including the idea of multi-user operating systems and hierarchial file systems.**

**Unix is the _grandfather_ of many modern operating systems.**

### Unix Philosophy:

_Unix philosophy emphasizes modular software design and the creation of small individual programs that can be combined to perform complex task._

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

### True UNIX:

_Today the name `UNIX` is a trademark of a global consortium called `The Open Group`. They maintain a set of standards called the `Single UNIX Specification`, which describes the core commands, features, interfaces, utilities, and more that define a UNIX operating system._

_The Open Group will certify an operating system as fully UNIX compliant if it passes conformance tests. Companies must pay to be tested and must further pay to use the UNIX trademark._

### Unix-like Operating Systems:

_Many operating systems are based on the original `UNIX` operating systems and are compatible with the `UNIX Standards`, but are **NOT** considered UNIX because they have not been certified by `The Open Group`. Often this is because of financial considerations or ethical objections._

_We call these operating systems `UNIX-like` or `UNIX-based`. They fully or mostly meet the specifications but cannot globally use UNIX name._

## How Linux Came to Be?

### Free Software Movement:

**The free software movement was started in the early 1980s by Richard Stallman, a programmer at MIT. He was frustrated by the increasing restrictions on software and the increasing cost of software.**

**The movement's philosophy is that the computers and softwares should not prevent cooperation between users, and instead should have the goal of liberating everyone in cyberspace.**

**According to the movement's leader, Richard Stallman, _"Users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software._"**

### GNU Project:

**Richard Stallman was a leader in the group of developers who aimed to create Free Software alternatives to Unix.**

**In 1984, he began work on the GNU Project, with the goal of creating an operating system that included _"everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that was not Free._"**

### The Linux Kernel:

**Another developer, Linus Torvalds, was working on creating his own kernel known as `Linux`. _The kernel is the part of an OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software components._**

**At the time, many GNU _"pieces"_ were complete, but the kernel was missing. Linus Torvalds' kernel was combined with the GNU pieces to create the first _"GNU/Linux"_ operating system.**

### Kernel?

**A kernel is a computer program that forms the core of an operating system and manages critical tasks like:**

- _Memory management_
- _Task scheduling_
- _Management of system resources/hardware_

**While a kernel is a critical part of an operating system, it is not an operating system itself. Just like, an engine is the critical and core part of a car, but it is not a car itself.**

### Linux

**Today, the term `Linux` refers both to the kernel created by Linus Torvalds AND all the software that is part of the linux ecosystem.**

**Some users feel strongly that the name GNU/Linux should be used instead of just Linux to give credit to the GNU Project.**

### Linux Distributions:

**The Linux Kernel itself is not a full-blown operating system. When people refer to _"Linux"_, they are usually referring to a _"Linux Distribution"_, which is a complete operating system that includes the Linux Kernel and a collection of softwares/applications.**

**Typically, a Linux Distribution bundles together the Linux kernel, GNU tools, documentation, a package manager, a window system, and a desktop environment.**

**There are nearly 1000 Linux distros (short for distributions) available today. Some of the popular ones are:**

- _Ubuntu_
- _Debian_
- _Fedora_
- _Slackware_
