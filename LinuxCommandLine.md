**Majority of the popular Operating Systems (OS) that exists today, there are really two groups (leaving niches ones aside), _Microsoft Family_ and _Unix Family_.**

- **Microsoft Family**: Windows OS, specifically descendent of _Microsoft NT_.
- **Unix Family**: Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, etc.

## What is Unix?

---

**Unix was an operating system developed at AT&T Bell Labs in the late 1960s. Many of the innovations and design choices the original Unix team have lived on 50+ years later, including the idea of multi-user operating systems and hierarchial file systems.**

**Unix is the _grandfather_ of many modern operating systems.**

### Unix Philosophy:

_Unix philosophy emphasizes modular software design and the creation of small individual programs that can be combined to perform complex task._

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

### True UNIX:

_Today the name `UNIX` is a trademark of a global consortium called `The Open Group`. They maintain a set of standards called the `Single UNIX Specification`, which describes the core commands, features, interfaces, utilities, and more that define a UNIX operating system._

_The Open Group will certify an operating system as fully UNIX compliant if it passes conformance tests. Companies must pay to be tested and must further pay to use the UNIX trademark._

### Unix-like Operating Systems:

_Many operating systems are based on the original `UNIX` operating systems and are compatible with the `UNIX Standards`, but are **NOT** considered UNIX because they have not been certified by `The Open Group`. Often this is because of financial considerations or ethical objections._

_We call these operating systems `UNIX-like` or `UNIX-based`. They fully or mostly meet the specifications but cannot globally use UNIX name_
