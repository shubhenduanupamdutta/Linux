# Explaining Shell, Terminal and Bash

---

## Shell

---

#### A shell is a computer interface to an operating system. Shells expose the OS's services to a human user or other program.

#### The shell takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only way to interact with a computer.

#### It's named a shell because it's the _outer layer_ around the operating system, like a shell around an oyster.

## Terminal

---

#### A terminal is a program that runs a shell. Originally, terminals were physical devices, but these days we work with software terminals.

#### When I type some commands, the terminal sends them to the shell. When the shell has output, the terminal shows it to me. There are many terminal programs available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and there are many different shells.

## Bash

---

**On most Linux-based systems, the default shell program is `Bash`. There are many other shells, but the most common is `Bash`.**

**The name `Bash` is an acronym for `Bourne Again SHell`. It's a punny reference to the `Bourne Shell` called `sh`, an early shell written by Stephen Bourne.**

**Bash runs on pretty much every version of Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.**
